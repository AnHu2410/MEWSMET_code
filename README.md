# MEWSMET_code
Code for experiments presented in "Opinions are Buildings: Metaphors in Secondary Education EFL Essays" (HÃ¼lsing and Horbach, 2024).

For obtaining the data, please fill in the form "Data License Agreement" (tba) and send it to huelsing@uni-hildesheim.de. You will receive the MEWSMET corpus (MEWSMET.txt), as well as the original files from the MEWS corpus that were used for annotation and a list containing the scores that expert raters attributed to each of the essays (both contained in a directory called MEWS). 

In order to reproduce the experiments, the file MEWSMET.txt and the MEWS-directory have to be stored in the file [data](data).

Once the data has been stored, the Pearson correlation between TLMs / CMs / all metaphors and the essay scores, can be obtained by running python corpus.py.
